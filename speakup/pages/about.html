        <p>platform and website may vary, but our teams are working to enhance accessibility throughout. For more
          detailed information about the accessibility of specific products, please refer to the documentation linked
          from our Accessibility Directory below.

      <div class="detailsbox">
        <h4>Reading Experience:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen to all of the website using a screen reader (e.g. the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
            VoiceOver), including image descriptions for images that convey meaning, form elements and links with a
            descriptive label
          </li>
          <li>Understand the meaning of images and icons described by meaningful alternative text which explains its
            purpose within the context of the content. Some content may not have text alternatives available for figures
            and other graphics. If you encounter an image that does not have a text alternative, and you need one, you
            can request alternative text for specific images
          </li>
          <li>Understand the function of all form elements. All form fields have descriptive labels which explain their
            meaning and any that are mandatory to complete the form.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="detailsbox">
        <h4>Available formats:</h4>
        <p>For optimal reading experience we recommend accessing content in HTML or EPUB format where available. These
          formats help to ensure text reflows correctly, images include alternative descriptions and that tables are
          appropriately.
          Where a work is unavailable in a suitable format (for example as an EPUB or fully typeset PDF), we recommend
          that disability officers first try obtaining the title through our partner.
